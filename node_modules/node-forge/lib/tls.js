 *
 * The TLS Handshake Protocol involves the following steps:
 *
 * - Exchange hello messages to agree on algorithms, exchange random values,
 * and check for session resumption.
 *
 * - Exchange the necessary cryptographic parameters to allow the client and
 * server to agree on a premaster secret.
 *
 * - Exchange certificates and cryptographic information to allow the client
 * and server to authenticate themselves.
 *
 * - Generate a master secret from the premaster secret and exchanged random
 * values.
 *
 * - Provide security parameters to the record layer.
 *
 * - Allow the client and server to verify that their peer has calculated the
 * same security parameters and that the handshake occurred without tampering
 * by an attacker.
 *
 * Up to 4 different messages may be sent during a key exchange. The server
 * certificate, the server key exchange, the client certificate, and the
 * client key exchange.
 *
 * A typical handshake (from the client's perspective).
 *
 * 1. Client sends ClientHello.
 * 2. Client receives ServerHello.
 * 3. Client receives optional Certificate.
 * 4. Client receives optional ServerKeyExchange.
 * 5. Client receives ServerHelloDone.
 * 6. Client sends optional Certificate.
 * 7. Client sends ClientKeyExchange.
 * 8. Client sends optional CertificateVerify.
 * 9. Client sends ChangeCipherSpec.
 * 10. Client sends Finished.
 * 11. Client receives ChangeCipherSpec.
 * 12. Client receives Finished.
 * 13. Client sends/receives application data.
 *
 * To reuse an existing session:
 *
 * 1. Client sends ClientHello with session ID for reuse.
 * 2. Client receives ServerHello with same session ID if reusing.
 * 3. Client receives ChangeCipherSpec message if reusing.
 * 4. Client receives Finished.
 * 5. Client sends ChangeCipherSpec.
 * 6. Client sends Finished.
 *
 * Note: Client ignores HelloRequest if in the middle of a handshake.
 *
 * Record Layer:
 *
 * The record layer fragments information blocks into TLSPlaintext records
 * carrying data in chunks of 2^14 bytes or less. Client message boundaries are
 * not preserved in the record layer (i.e., multiple client messages of the
 * same ContentType MAY be coalesced into a single TLSPlaintext record, or a
 * single message MAY be fragmented across several records).
 *
 * struct {
 *   uint8 major;
 *   uint8 minor;
 * } ProtocolVersion;
 *
 * struct {
 *   ContentType type;
 *   ProtocolVersion version;
 *   uint16 length;
 *   opaque fragment[TLSPlaintext.length];
 * } TLSPlaintext;
 *
 * type:
 *   The higher-level protocol used to process the enclosed fragment.
 *
 * version:
 *   The version of the protocol being employed. TLS Version 1.2 uses version
 *   {3, 3}. TLS Version 1.0 uses version {3, 1}. Note that a client that
 *   supports multiple versions of TLS may not know what version will be
 *   employed before it receives the ServerHello.
 *
 * length:
 *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSPlaintext.fragment. The length
 *   MUST NOT exceed 2^14 = 16384 bytes.
 *
 * fragment:
 *   The application data. This data is transparent and treated as an
 *   independent block to be dealt with by the higher-level protocol specified
 *   by the type field.
 *
 * Implementations MUST NOT send zero-length fragments of Handshake, Alert, or
 * ChangeCipherSpec content types. Zero-length fragments of Application data
 * MAY be sent as they are potentially useful as a traffic analysis
 * countermeasure.
 *
 * Note: Data of different TLS record layer content types MAY be interleaved.
 * Application data is generally of lower precedence for transmission than
 * other content types. However, records MUST be delivered to the network in
 * the same order as they are protected by the record layer. Recipients MUST
 * receive and process interleaved application layer traffic during handshakes
 * subsequent to the first one on a connection.
 *
 * struct {
 *   ContentType type;       // same as TLSPlaintext.type
 *   ProtocolVersion version;// same as TLSPlaintext.version
 *   uint16 length;
 *   opaque fragment[TLSCompressed.length];
 * } TLSCompressed;
 *
 * length:
 *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSCompressed.fragment.
 *   The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 1024.
 *
 * fragment:
 *   The compressed form of TLSPlaintext.fragment.
 *
 * Note: A CompressionMethod.null operation is an identity operation; no fields
 * are altered. In this implementation, since no compression is supported,
 * uncompressed records are always the same as compressed records.
 *
 * Encryption Information:
 *
 * The encryption and MAC functions translate a TLSCompressed structure into a
 * TLSCiphertext. The decryption functions reverse the process. The MAC of the
 * record also includes a sequence number so that missing, extra, or repeated
 * messages are detectable.
 *
 * struct {
 *   ContentType type;
 *   ProtocolVersion version;
 *   uint16 length;
 *   select (SecurityParameters.cipher_type) {
 *     case stream: GenericStreamCipher;
 *     case block:  GenericBlockCipher;
 *     case aead:   GenericAEADCipher;
 *   } fragment;
 * } TLSCiphertext;
 *
 * type:
 *   The type field is identical to TLSCompressed.type.
 *
 * version:
 *   The version field is identical to TLSCompressed.version.
 *
 * length:
 *   The length (in bytes) of the following TLSCiphertext.fragment.
 *   The length MUST NOT exceed 2^14 + 2048.
 *
 * fragment:
 *   The encrypted form of TLSCompressed.fragment, with the MAC.
 *
 * Note: Only CBC Block Ciphers are supported by this implementation.
 *
 * The TLSCompressed.fragment structures are converted to/from block
 * TLSCiphertext.fragment structures.
 *
 * struct {
 *   opaque IV[SecurityParameters.record_iv_length];
 *   block-ciphered struct {
 *     opaque content[TLSCompressed.length];
 *     opaque MAC[SecurityParameters.mac_length];
 *     uint8 padding[GenericBlockCipher.padding_length];
 *     uint8 padding_length;
 *   };
 * } GenericBlockCipher;
 *
 * The MAC is generated as described in Section 6.2.3.1.
 *
 * IV:
 *   The Initialization Vector (IV) SHOULD be chosen at random, and MUST be
 *   unpredictable. Note that in versions of TLS prior to 1.1, there was no
 *   IV field, and the last ciphertext block of the previous record (the "CBC
 *   residue") was used as the IV. This was changed to prevent the attacks
 *   described in [CBCATT]. For block ciphers, the IV length is of length
 *   SecurityParameters.record_iv_length, which is equal to the
 *   SecurityParameters.block_size.
 *
 * padding:
 *   Padding that is added to force the length of the plaintext to be an
 *   integral multiple of the block cipher's block length. The padding MAY be
 *   any length up to 255 bytes, as long as it results in the
 *   TLSCiphertext.length being an integral multiple of the block length.
 *   Lengths longer than necessary might be desirable to frustrate attacks on
 *   a protocol that are based on analysis of the lengths of exchanged
 *   messages. Each uint8 in the padding data vector MUST be filled with the
 *   padding length value. The receiver MUST check this padding and MUST use
 *   the bad_record_mac alert to indicate padding errors.
 *
 * padding_length:
 *   The padding length MUST be such that the total size of the
 *   GenericBlockCipher structure is a multiple of the cipher's block length.
 *   Legal values range from zero to 255, inclusive. This length specifies the
 *   length of the padding field exclusive of the padding_length field itself.
 *
 * The encrypted data length (TLSCiphertext.length) is one more than the sum of
 * SecurityParameters.block_length, TLSCompressed.length,
 * SecurityParameters.mac_length, and padding_length.
 *
 * Example: If the block length is 8 bytes, the content length
 * (TLSCompressed.length) is 61 bytes, and the MAC length is 20 bytes, then the
 * length before padding is 82 bytes (this does not include the IV. Thus, the
 * padding length modulo 8 must be equal to 6 in order to make the total length
 * an even multiple of 8 bytes (the block length). The padding length can be
 * 6, 14, 22, and so on, through 254. If the padding length were the minimum
 * necessary, 6, the padding would be 6 bytes, each containing the value 6.
 * Thus, the last 8 octets of the GenericBlockCipher before block encryption
 * would be xx 06 06 06 06 06 06 06, where xx is the last octet of the MAC.
 *
 * Note: With block ciphers in CBC mode (Cipher Block Chaining), it is critical
 * that the entire plaintext of the record be known before any ciphertext is
 * transmitted. Otherwise, it is possible for the attacker to mount the attack
 * described in [CBCATT].
 *
 * Implementation note: Canvel et al. [CBCTIME] have demonstrated a timing
 * attack on CBC padding based on the time required to compute the MAC. In
 * order to defend against this attack, implementations MUST ensure that
 * record processing time is essentially the same whether or not the padding
 * is correct. In general, the best way to do this is to compute the MAC even
 * if the padding is incorrect, and only then reject the packet. For instance,
 * if the pad appears to be incorrect, the implementation might assume a
 * zero-length pad and then compute the MAC. This leaves a small timing
 * channel, since MAC performance depends, to some extent, on the size of the
 * data fragment, but it is not believed to be large enough to be exploitable,
 * due to the large block size of existing MACs and the small size of the
 * timing signal.

/**
 * Generates pseudo random bytes by mixing the result of two hash functions,

 *
 * prf_TLS1(secret, label, seed) =

 *   A(0) = seed
 *   A(i) = HMAC_hash(secret, A(i-1))
 *
 * The '+' operator denotes concatenation.
 *
 * As many iterations A(N) as are needed are performed to generate enough
 * pseudo random byte output. If an iteration creates more data than is
 * necessary, then it is truncated.

 *
 * The Record Protocol requires an algorithm to generate keys required by the
 * current connection state.
 *
 * The master secret is expanded into a sequence of secure bytes, which is then
 * split to a client write MAC key, a server write MAC key, a client write
 * encryption key, and a server write encryption key. In TLS 1.0 a client write
 * IV and server write IV are also generated. Each of these is generated from
 * the byte sequence in that order. Unused values are empty. In TLS 1.2, some
 * AEAD ciphers may additionally require a client write IV and a server write
 * IV (see Section 6.2.3.3).
 *
 * When keys, MAC keys, and IVs are generated, the master secret is used as an
 * entropy source.
 *
 * To generate the key material, compute:
 *
 * master_secret = PRF(pre_master_secret, "master secret",
 *                     ClientHello.random + ServerHello.random)
 *
 * key_block = PRF(SecurityParameters.master_secret,
 *                 "key expansion",
 *                 SecurityParameters.server_random +
 *                 SecurityParameters.client_random);
 *
 * until enough output has been generated. Then, the key_block is
 * partitioned as follows:
 *
 * client_write_MAC_key[SecurityParameters.mac_key_length]
 * server_write_MAC_key[SecurityParameters.mac_key_length]
 * client_write_key[SecurityParameters.enc_key_length]
 * server_write_key[SecurityParameters.enc_key_length]
 * client_write_IV[SecurityParameters.fixed_iv_length]
 * server_write_IV[SecurityParameters.fixed_iv_length]
 *
 * In TLS 1.2, the client_write_IV and server_write_IV are only generated for
 * implicit nonce techniques as described in Section 3.2.1 of [AEAD]. This
 * implementation uses TLS 1.0 so IVs are generated.
 *
 * Implementation note: The currently defined cipher suite which requires the
 * most material is AES_256_CBC_SHA256. It requires 2 x 32 byte keys and 2 x 32
 * byte MAC keys, for a total 128 bytes of key material. In TLS 1.0 it also
 * requires 2 x 16 byte IVs, so it actually takes 160 bytes of key material.
 *
 * @param c the connection.
 * @param sp the security parameters to use.
 *
 * @return the security keys.

 *
 * Meaning of this message:
 *   If RSA is being used for key agreement and authentication, the client
 *   generates a 48-byte premaster secret, encrypts it using the public key
 *   from the server's certificate or the temporary RSA key provided in a

/**
 * Creates a new TLS connection. This does not make any assumptions about the
 * transport layer that TLS is working on top of, ie: it does not assume there
 * is a TCP/IP connection or establish one. A TLS connection is totally
 * abstracted away from the layer is runs on top of, it merely establishes a
 * secure channel between a client" and a "server".
 *
 * A TLS connection contains 4 connection states: pending read and write, and
 * current read and write.
 *
 * At initialization, the current read and write states will be null. Only once
 * the security parameters have been set and the keys have been generated can
 * the pending states be converted into current states. Current states will be
 * updated for each record processed.
 *
 * A custom certificate verify callback may be provided to check information
 * like the common name on the server's certificate. It will be called for
 * every certificate in the chain. It has the following signature:
 *
 * variable func(c, certs, index, preVerify)
 * Where:
 * c         The TLS connection
 * verified  Set to true if certificate was verified, otherwise the alert
 *           tls.Alert.Description for why the certificate failed.
 * depth     The current index in the chain, where 0 is the server's cert.
 * certs     The certificate chain, *NOTE* if the server was anonymous then
 *           the chain will be empty.
 *
 * The function returns true on success and on failure either the appropriate
 * tls.Alert.Description or an object with 'alert' set to the appropriate
 * tls.Alert.Description and 'message' set to a custom error message. If true
 * is not returned then the connection will abort using, in order of
 * availability, first the returned alert description, second the preVerify
 * alert description, and lastly the default 'bad_certificate'.
 *
 * There are three callbacks that can be used to make use of client-side
 * certificates where each takes the TLS connection as the first parameter:
 *
 * getCertificate(conn, hint)
 *   The second parameter is a hint as to which certificate should be
 *   returned. If the connection entity is a client, then the hint will be
 *   the CertificateRequest message from the server that is part of the
 *   TLS protocol. If the connection entity is a server, then it will be
 *   the servername list provided via an SNI extension the ClientHello, if
 *   one was provided (empty array if not). The hint can be examined to
 *   determine which certificate to use (advanced). Most implementations
 *   will just return a certificate. The return value must be a
 *   PEM-formatted certificate or an array of PEM-formatted certificates
 *   that constitute a certificate chain, with the first in the array/chain
 *   being the client's certificate.
 * getPrivateKey(conn, certificate)
 *   The second parameter is an forge.pki X.509 certificate object that
 *   is associated with the requested private key. The return value must
 *   be a PEM-formatted private key.
 * getSignature(conn, bytes, callback)
 *   This callback can be used instead of getPrivateKey if the private key
 *   is not directly accessible in javascript or should not be. For
 *   instance, a secure external web service could provide the signature
 *   in exchange for appropriate credentials. The second parameter is a
 *   string of bytes to be signed that are part of the TLS protocol. These
 *   bytes are used to verify that the private key for the previously
 *   provided client-side certificate is accessible to the client. The
 *   callback is a function that takes 2 parameters, the TLS connection
 *   and the RSA encrypted (signed) bytes as a string. This callback must
 *   be called once the signature is ready.
 *
 * @param options the options for this connection:
 *   server: true if the connection is server-side, false for client.
 *   sessionId: a session ID to reuse, null for a new connection.
 *   caStore: an array of certificates to trust.
 *   sessionCache: a session cache to use.
 *   cipherSuites: an optional array of cipher suites to use,
 *     see tls.CipherSuites.
 *   connected: function(conn) called when the first handshake completes.
 *   virtualHost: the virtual server name to use in a TLS SNI extension.
 *   verifyClient: true to require a client certificate in server mode,
 *     'optional' to request one, false not to (default: false).
 *   verify: a handler used to custom verify certificates in the chain.
 *   verifyOptions: an object with options for the certificate chain validation.
 *     See documentation of pki.verifyCertificateChain for possible options.
 *     verifyOptions.verify is ignored. If you wish to specify a verify handler
 *     use the verify key.
 *   getCertificate: an optional callback used to get a certificate or
 *     a chain of certificates (as an array).
 *   getPrivateKey: an optional callback used to get a private key.
 *   getSignature: an optional callback used to get a signature.
 *   tlsDataReady: function(conn) called when TLS protocol data has been
 *     prepared and is ready to be used (typically sent over a socket
 *     connection to its destination), read from conn.tlsData buffer.
 *   dataReady: function(conn) called when application data has
 *     been parsed from a TLS record and should be consumed by the
 *     application, read from conn.data buffer.
 *   closed: function(conn) called when the connection has been closed.
 *   error: function(conn, error) called when there was an error.
 *   deflate: function(inBytes) if provided, will deflate TLS records using
 *     the deflate algorithm if the server supports it.
 *   inflate: function(inBytes) if provided, will inflate TLS records using
 *     the deflate algorithm if the server supports it.
 *
 * @return the new TLS connection.
